#### Test TC007 Copy script content to clipboard
- **Test Code:** [TC007_Copy_script_content_to_clipboard.py](./TC007_Copy_script_content_to_clipboard.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify that clicking the copy button on a script copies the script text to the clipboard and shows a confirmation toast is partially complete. We confirmed that clicking the copy button opens the script editing modal with the expected script text visible, indicating the copy action triggers the script display. However, despite multiple attempts and page reloads, no confirmation toast notification was detected on the page after clicking the copy button. Clipboard content verification was indirect via visible script text, as direct clipboard access is restricted. Therefore, the copy functionality is partially verified, but the confirmation toast notification could not be confirmed. Task success is set to false due to the missing confirmation toast verification.

#### Test TC008 Exam management CRUD operations
- **Test Code:** [TC008_Exam_management_CRUD_operations.py](./TC008_Exam_management_CRUD_operations.py)
- **Test Error:** The test to verify that a user with coordinator permissions can create, edit, view details, and delete medical exams was not fully completed. The user successfully logged in and navigated to the exams module. A new exam was created, but it did not appear in the exam list or search results, preventing verification of its presence. Attempts to create another exam were interrupted by a browser error page, which blocked further actions. Therefore, the test could not confirm editing, viewing details, or deleting exams. The task is incomplete due to these issues.

- **Test Code:** [TC009_Contact_management_with_clusters_and_contact_points.py](./TC009_Contact_management_with_clusters_and_contact_points.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify creation, editing, viewing, and deletion of contact groups (clusters) and their contact points was not fully completed. Although login and navigation to the contacts module were successful, attempts to create a new contact cluster failed due to input field interaction issues and unexpected navigation away from the contacts module. The hierarchical relationships and deletion steps could not be tested. The system navigated to an error page at the end, preventing further actions. Task incomplete.

#### Test TC016 Internal messaging (recados) creation and filtering
- **Test Code:** [TC016_Internal_messaging_recados_creation_and_filtering.py](./TC016_Internal_messaging_recados_creation_and_filtering.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify users can create internal messages, filter messages by sector, and view message history with timestamps could not be fully completed. Although login and navigation to the internal messages module were initially successful, attempts to create new messages and verify filtering failed due to repeated application navigation errors and page load failures. The application often navigated to incorrect pages or error pages, and input fields did not accept text input as expected. Therefore, full verification of message creation, filtering by sector, and message history with timestamps was not possible in this session.

#### Test TC023 Form validation with Zod schemas
- **Test Code:** [TC023_Form_validation_with_Zod_schemas.py](./TC023_Form_validation_with_Zod_schemas.py)
- **Test Error:** Validation testing on data entry forms for scripts and exams revealed critical issues: the 'Adicionar Novo Script' form does not show inline validation errors on empty mandatory fields submission, and the 'Novo Exame' form does not open as expected. Due to these blockers, further validation testing cannot proceed. Recommend developer investigation and fixes for form validation and UI responsiveness to enable proper validation testing.
